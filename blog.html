                <h2>Quick summary</h2>
                <p>In this two-part series, Andrii Zhdan outlines common challenges faced at the start of a design career and offers advice to smooth your journey based on insights from his experience hiring designers. In Part 2, Andrii speaks about how you can grow faster in your brand-new junior UX job.</p>
                <p>In the previous article in my two-part series, I have explained how important it is to start by mastering your design tools, to work on your portfolio (even if you have very little work experience — which is to be expected at this stage), and to carefully prepare for your first design interviews.</p>
                <p>If all goes according to plan, and with a little bit of luck, you’ll land your first junior UX job — and then, of course, you’ll be facing more challenges, about which I am about to speak in this second article in my two-part article series.</p>

                <h2>In Your New Junior UX Job: On the Way to Grow</h2>
                <p> You have probably heard of the Pareto Rule, which states that 20% of actions provide 80% of the results.</p>
                <blockquote>
                    <p>“The Pareto Principle is a concept that specifies that 80% of consequences come from 20% of the causes, asserting an unequal relationship between inputs and outputs. The principle was named after the economist Vilfredo Pareto.”</p>
                    <cite>— “The Pareto Principle, a.k.a. the Pareto Rule”</cite>
                </blockquote>

                <p>This means that some of your actions will help you grow much faster than others.</p>
                <p>But before we go into the details, let’s briefly consider the junior UX designer path. I think it’s clear that, at first, juniors usually assist other designers with simple but time-consuming tasks. Then, the level of complexity and your responsibilities start increasing, depending on your performance.</p>
                <p>So, you got your first design job? Great! Here are a few things you can focus on if you want to be growing at a faster pace.</p>

                <h2>Chase For Challenges</h2>
                <p>The simple but slow way to go is to do your work and then wait until your superiors notice how good you are and start giving you more complex tasks. The problem is that people focus on themselves too much.</p>
                <p>So, to “cut some corners,” you need to actively look for challenges. It’s scary, I know, but remember, people who invented any new groundbreaking UX approach or a new framework you see in books and manuals now used their intuition first. You have the whole World Wide Web full of articles and lectures about that. So, define the skill you want to develop, spend a day reading about this topic, find a real problem, and practice. Then, share what you did and get some feedback. After a few iterations, I bet you will be assigned the first real task for your practice!</p>

                <h2> Use Interfaces Consciously</h2>
                <p>Take the time to look again at the screenshot of the Amazon website (from Part One):</p>
                
                <!-- insert amazon-homepage-kindle.png -->

                <p>User interfaces didn’t appear in their present form right from the start. Instead, they evolved to their current state over the span of many years. And you all were part of their evolution, albeit passively — you registered on different websites, reset your passwords quite a few times, clicked onboarding screens, filled out short and long web forms, used search, and so on.</p>
                <p>In your design work, all tasks (or 99% of them, at least at the beginning) will be based on those UX patterns. You don’t need to reinvent the bicycle; you only need to remember what you already know and pay attention to the details while using the interfaces of the apps on your smartphone and on your computer. Ask yourself:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Why was this designed this way?</li>
                    <li>What is not clear enough for me as a user?</li>
                    <li>What is thought out well and what is not?</li>
                </ul>
                <p>All of today’s great design solutions were built based on common sense and then documented so that other people can learn how to re-use this knowledge. Develop your own “common sense” skill every day by being a careful observer and by living your life consciously. Notice the patterns of good design, try to understand and memorize them, and then implement and rethink them in your own work.</p>
                <p>I can also highly recommend the Smart Interface Design Patterns course with Vitaly Friedman. It provides guidelines and best practices for common components in modern interfaces. Inventing a new solution for every problem takes time, and too often, it’s just unnecessary. Instead, we can rely on bulletproof design patterns to avoid issues down the line. This course helps with just that. In the course, you will study hundreds of hand-picked examples, from complex navigation to filters, tables, and forms, and you will work on actual real-life challenges.</p>

                <h2>Learn How to Present Your Work</h2>
                <p>The ability to convey complex thoughts and ideas in the form of clear sentences defines how effectively you will be able to interact with other people.</p>
